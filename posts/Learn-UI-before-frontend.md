title: 'Learn UI before frontend?'

I am currently working on a full stack project (a [time tracker](https://github.com/not-a-ethan/time-tracker)).  
​  
I finished the back end of it and now I am working on the front end. But I am not a good designer and I want to try and learn web design. But should I pause working on the project to learn web design and resume. Or should I make the front end with poor design, learn web design and than re-make it with a good design?  
​  
On one hand I dont want to take a break from the project and possibly loose motivation after I learn UI. But on the other hand I dont think making a front end to just re-do it and never use it is worth it. So Im not sure witch one I should do.
